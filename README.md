# Alice
Intellegent System for Personal Management

This project is currently under development

Goals for v0.01;
-Creation of base clases to store information
-Outline achievable goals for project moving forward


Alice is being developed as a personal assistant which collects and aggregates data based on your digital life.
By connecting information from common sources such as calanders, contacts, location and personal messages, the goal is 
to help people take control of their data, by keeping it away from servers and on their machine. Ofcourse users may want the choice to 
upload the information, but ultimately that is their choice. Using this data, Alice should then make simple decisions 
such as suggesting the best place for two people to meet based on previous encounters or asking alice to find two hours
in your schedule for relaxing. Alice should then shuffle the information around and provide it to you in a format your
favorite calendar or messaging app can recieve without interfering. More importantly, alice should protect the data 
and remain in the background as much as possible.
